Planned Kubernetes SIT On-Premises Version Upgrade – Scheduled Downtime

Dear Team,

This is to inform you that we will be performing a Kubernetes SIT on-premises version upgrade as part of our scheduled infrastructure maintenance.

To complete this activity safely and ensure platform stability, there will be a planned downtime during the upgrade window:

Maintenance Window:
	•	Friday, [Date] – Full Day
	•	Saturday, [Date] – Full Day

During this period, all applications and services running in the SIT on-premises Kubernetes cluster will remain unavailable. Normal operations will resume once the upgrade is completed and validated.

We request all teams to plan their activities accordingly and avoid deploying any changes during the above window.

A confirmation email will be sent once the upgrade is successfully completed.

For any concerns or clarifications, please feel free to reach out.
