This is to inform you that we will upgrade the Kubernetes SIT on-premises version as part of our regular infrastructure maintenance.  To conduct this action properly and guarantee platform stability, there will be a scheduled downtime throughout the upgrading window:  During this time, all applications and services operating in the SIT's on-premises Kubernetes cluster will be unavailable. Normal operations will resume once the upgrade is complete and confirmed.  We recommend that all teams schedule their work accordingly and avoid deploying any modifications during the above time frame. Once the upgrade is finished successfully, you will receive a confirmation email.  If you have any problems or need clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.
