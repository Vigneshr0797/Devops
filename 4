✅ YOUR WORKER NODE IS PERFECTLY FINE

From this output:

eqvlws02apsit13   Ready   <none>

No taints
Ready = True
Calico = Running
Kubelet = Healthy
Containers running normally

👉 So worker node is 100% healthy
👉 The scheduling issue is NOT because of this node

⸻

🚨 THE REAL PROBLEM IS THIS LINE FROM YOUR EARLIER ERROR

Your Deployment events showed:

0/2 nodes available:  
1 node had un-tolerated taint {node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane}  
1 node had taint node.kubernetes.io/not-ready

NOW we know the truth:

➡ The “NotReady” node was actually the CONTROL-PLANE at that time — NOT your worker!

And based on your latest logs from master:

Volume detached ...
Cleaned up orphaned pod volumes ...
Calico restarting ...

Your master node went unhealthy temporarily
This is why the scheduler showed:

1 node had not-ready taint
1 node had control-plane taint (NoSchedule)

📌 Worker node was NOT the problem at all.
📌 Control plane node temporarily NotReady + NoSchedule = 0 nodes available

⸻

🔥 SO WHY IS YOUR POD STILL NOT SCHEDULING?

Your pod includes a PVC:

PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) — using storage

Persistent storage has node affinity.

Your PV likely has NodeAffinity bound to control-plane node

This means the PV can only attach to master, but master is tainted → so pod cannot schedule.

Let’s confirm.

Run this:

kubectl get pv

Identify your PV → then run:

kubectl describe pv <pv-name>

If you see:

nodeAffinity:
  required:
    nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
          - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
            operator: In
            values:
            - eqvlwso2apsit15   (control-plane)

Then PVC is locked to master node
And your master node has:

node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule

So the pod can NEVER run on worker.

⸻

✅ FIX OPTIONS

Option 1 — Allow pod to run on master (temporary fix)

Edit Deployment → add tolerations:

tolerations:
- key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"

Then:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

Your pod will run on master.

⸻

Option 2 — Move PV/PVC to worker node (recommended)

If using hostPath → you must re-create PV pointing to worker.

If using NFS, Ceph, StorageClass → make sure StorageClass supports multi-node provisioning.

⸻

🧵 NEXT STEP — SEND ME THIS

Run both and paste:

kubectl get pvc -n <your-namespace>
kubectl describe pv <pv-name>

I will tell you exactly why the pod is forced onto the master node.
