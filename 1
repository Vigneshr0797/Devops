Great — I reviewed both files.
**Your kubelet failure is 100% confirmed because of ONE mistake:**

# ❌ **Duplicate entry in /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml**

You have this line **twice**:

```
rotateCertificates: true
```

Once here ⬇️

```
protectKernelDefaults: true
rotateCertificates: true
```

And again here ⬇️

```
nodeStatusUpdateFrequency: 0s
rotateCertificates: true
```

This causes:

```
strict decoding error: key "rotateCertificates" already set in map
```

Kubelet will **not start** until this is fixed.

---

# ✅ **FIX**

Edit the file:

```
sudo vi /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```

Remove **one** of the two duplicate lines.

Keep ONLY one:

```
rotateCertificates: true
```

Save & exit.

Then restart services:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

---

# 🟢 **Your kube-apiserver.yaml looks fine**

The API server manifest has **no errors**.
So once kubelet starts and your master’s API server is reachable, the node will join.

---

# ❗IMPORTANT

After fixing kubelet, if connection refused error continues:

Run on master (10.57.12.120):

```
crictl ps | grep apiserver
crictl logs <container-id>
```

But **first fix the kubelet YAML duplicate** — that is guaranteed error.

---

If you want, paste kubelet logs after restart and I will confirm everything is fixed.
